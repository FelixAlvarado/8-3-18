what  is the danger of an XSS?

It can result in dangerous code being inserted in the database and eventially in the user's browser, where would have access to many things like the user's cookies. 

Discuss 4 difference between ES5 and ES6: 

Blockscope (let and const) 

Lexical "this" (fat arrow being based on physical location)

Dealing with "arguments" - rest parameter (...args) so result has all array properties 

classes - etter "ruby like" syntax 

strict mode - needed automatically used w/ ES6 features
